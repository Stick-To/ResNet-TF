# Resnet-v2 in Tensorflow
The residual block use the proposed mode in https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027  which is known as resnet-v2

# Modular
Any number of layers network  could be initialized by python list

# Requirements
Tensorflow 1.x

python 3.x

# Test 
resnet50 with bottleneck, test accuracy 92+%
